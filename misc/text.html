      <h2><span class="callout">h2: </span>Characteristics</h2>
      <p>The horn shark is a small, common, bottom-dweller in the warm waters off western North America. It belongs to the bullhead shark family (Heterodontidae). Its name comes from its short, blunt head with high ridges above the eyes. It has large spines on its two high dorsal fins, and many small dark spots on brownish gray skin. Most adults measure about 1 m, and the maximum length of this species is 1.2 m (3.3 ft).</p>
<p>Horn sharks have a small home range, usually no larger than 1,000 m². They like to stay put in the same general area, remaining there year after year. The longest distance a horn shark is known to have traveled is 16.3 km (10 miles)!</p>

      <h2><span class="callout">h2: </span>Behavior</h2>
      <p>Environmental light levels control their daily activity, with horn sharks being most active at night. And they definitely don’t like the cold: their abundance is linked to water temperature, preferably over 21°C (70°F).</p>
<p>Horn sharks can end up with purple stained teeth from eating so many sea urchins!</p>
